<p>Overall, my research has focused on developing and testing predictions of a computational model of visual working memory, measuring the effects that attention has on memory precision, and evaluating how eye movements predict detection of hazards when driving. I have utilized a variety of methods to study attention and memory, including psychophysical paradigms, computational modeling and simulations, machine learning for parameter optimization, driving simulation, eye and head tracking, and electroencephalography (EEG).</p>
